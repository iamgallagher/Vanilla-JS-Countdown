# Vanilla JavaScript Countdown Timer

This project is made  out of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. <br>
The reason I made this project was just to practice JavaScript. <br>
In order to recreate this project, you will not need anything besides your code editor of choice! I personally use Visual Studio Code.
